## 🖥️ Overview

This repository documents the recovery and customization of a compact 7-inch Windows 11 device—codenamed **Blackjack**—after instability caused by Insider builds and system-level failures. Through a combination of driver recovery, input remapping, and narrative-driven documentation, this project showcases both technical resilience and creative problem-solving.

## 📁 Repository Structure

| Folder         | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `scripts/`     | Contains remap tools (`left click.exe`, `right click.exe`) and their AHK source files |
| `drivers/`     | Placeholder for exported drivers from the working system |
| `docs/`        | Recovery logs, system overview, and narrative notes (coming soon) |
| `assets/`      | Screenshots and visual documentation (e.g., system tray, key identifier output) |

## 🧰 Included Tools

### ✅ Input Remap Scripts

- `left click.exe` / `right click.exe`: Executables that remap specific keyboard keys to mouse buttons
- `.ahk` source files included for transparency and customization
- `key-identifier.ahk`: Used to determine which scan codes correspond to the keyboard’s built-in mouse buttons

These tools are essential for restoring full usability on a device with limited physical input options.

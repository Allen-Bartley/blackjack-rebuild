# Project: Blackjack  
*A Recovery Log, A Tribute, A Testament to Resilience*

> “We’re going to make this 7-inch laptop get off of the mattress.”

## 🖥️ Overview

This repository documents the resurrection of a compact ultra-portable system—originally broken by Insider builds, obscure drivers, and a cascade of system failures. Rebuilt through persistence, creativity, and a little storytelling magic, the system has been renamed **Blackjack**, in honor of the protagonist from *Fallout: Equestria – Project Horizons*.

This is not just a recovery guide. It’s a story of survival.

## 🔧 Recovery Process

- Reclaimed USB drive from fragmented Linux partitions using MiniTool Partition Wizard
- Created bootable Windows 11 installer on 32GB USB (FAT32)
- Launched `setup.exe` from within Windows due to boot menu issues
- Performed in-place reinstall with “Keep files” option
- Recovered touchscreen functionality and remap scripts (`left click.exe`, `right click.exe`)
- Paused Windows Update and queued for Insider unenrollment

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “Her talent wasn’t winning. It was surviving.”

Blackjack’s story isn’t about perfection—it’s about persistence. This system, like its namesake, was broken, patched, and pushed beyond its limits. But it still stands. This repo is a tribute to that spirit: of rebuilding, adapting, and carrying forward something meaningful.
